Generic methods are a very efficient way to handle multiple datatypes using a single method.
 This problem will test your knowledge on Java Generic methods.

Let's say you have an integer array and a string array. You have to write a single method printArray that can print all the elements of both arrays. 
The method should be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays.


import java.io.IOException;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

class Printer
{
   
    public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
        for (T item : array) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }

 
}
