2)Given an array,A, of  N integers and an array, W, representing the respective weights of A's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of A's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of  decimal place
Input format:
1.The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in arrays A and W.
2.The second line contains  N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array A .
3.The third line contains  N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of W array .
Output format:
•Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of  1 decimal place (i.e.,  format).

Constraints:
•N=[5 to 50]
•ai=[0 to 100]
•Wi=[0 to. 100]

Program:

def weightedMean(A,W,n) : 
    sum = 0
    numWeight = 0
    i = 0
    while  i < n : 
          
        numWeight = numWeight + A[i] * W[i] 
        sum = sum + W[i] 
        i = i + 1
   
    return (float)(numWeight / sum) 
  
n=int(input())
for i in range(0,n):
   A[i]=int(input())
for i in range(0,n):
   W[i]=int(input())  
print weightedMean(X, W, n)
