1.Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.
Test case:
Number 1 – 20
Number 2 – 20.38
Sum = 40.38
There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric

c program
#include<stdio.h>
addition(int x, float y)
{
    float ans;
    ans = (float)x + y;
    printf("Answer : %.2f",ans);
}
int main()
{
   int a;
   float b;
   printf("enter first number : ");
   scanf("%d",&a);
   printf("enter second number : ");
   scanf("%f",&b);
   addition(a, b);
}


2.Consider the below series :
0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8
This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous  term using the formula (x/2)
Write a program to find the nth term in this series.
The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.
For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.
You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000

c program
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, n, a=0, b=0;
    printf("enter number : ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        if(i%2!=0)
        {
            if(i>1)
                a = a + 2;
        }
        else
        {
            b = a/2;
        }
    }

    if(n%2!=0)
    {
        printf("%d",a);
    }
    else
    { 
        printf("%d",b);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
3.Given a maximum of four digit to the base 17 (10 – A, 11 – B, 12 – C, 13 – D … 16 – G} as input, output its decimal value.
Test Cases
Case 1
Input – 1A
Expected Output – 27
Case 2
Input – 23GF
Expected Output – 10980

c program
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(){

  char hex[17];
  long long decimal, place;

  int i = 0, val, len;
  decimal = 0;
  place = 1;

  scanf("%s",hex);

  len = strlen(hex);
  len--;

  for(i = 0;hex[i]!='\0';i++)
  {
    if(hex[i]>='0'&& hex[i]<='9'){

      //48 to 57 are ascii values of 0 - 9
      //say value is 8 its ascii will be 56
      //val = hex[i] - 48 => 56 - 48 => val = 8

      val = hex[i] - 48;
    }
    else if(hex[i]>='a'&& hex[i]<='g'){

      //97 to 103 are ascii values of a - g
      //say value is g its ascii will be 103
      //val = hex[i] - 97 + 10 => 103 - 97 + 10=> val = 16
      //10 is added as g value is 16 not 6 or a value is 10 not 0

      val = hex[i] - 97 + 10;
    }
    else if(hex[i]>='A'&& hex[i]<='G'){

      //similarly, 65 to 71 are values of A - G
      val = hex[i] - 65 + 10;
    }

    decimal = decimal + val * pow(17,len);
    len--;
  }

  printf("%lld",decimal);

  return 0;
}
