Develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the following problems.

Activity 1

Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). 

The fee structure is as follows:
1.	If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.:fine=0).
2.	If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date :fine=Rs.15*(No. Of Days)
3.	If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine=Rs.500*(No. Of Days).
4.	If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of Rs. 10000.

Input Format
1.	The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective DD,MM, YY on which the book was actually returned.
2.	The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective DD,MM, YY on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).

Constraints
1.	DD={1 to 31}
2.	MM={1 to 12}
3.	YY={1 to 3000}
4.	Accept only valid dates

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.

Program:

#include <iostream>
int library_fine(int ret_day, int ret_mon, int ret_yr, int due_day, int due_mon, int due_year) 
{
    int fine = 0;
    if (ret_yr == due_year)
    {
        if (ret_mon == due_mon)
        {
            if (ret_day > due_day)
            {
                fine = 15 * (ret_day - due_day);
            }
        }
        else if (ret_mon > due_mon)
        {
            fine = 500 * (ret_mon - due_mon);
        }
    }
    else if (ret_yr > due_year)
    {
        fine = 10000;
    }
    return fine;
}
int main()
{
    int ret_day, ret_mon, ret_yr;
    int due_day, due_mon, due_year;
    std::cin >> ret_day >> ret_mon >> ret_yr;
    std::cin >> due_day >> due_mon >> due_year;
    std::cout << library_fine(ret_day, ret_mon, ret_yr, due_day, due_mon, due_year) << "\n";
}
