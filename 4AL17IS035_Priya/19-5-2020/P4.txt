He needs to create particular amount of bacteria. The bacteria multiplies exponentially. If he lets m bacteria to multiply n exponential times, he should check whether he will get the required amount of bacteria.

Input consists of three inputs. The no. of bacteria, m. The number in which it gets multiplied, n. The required number, req .

PROGRAM:

#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
int armstrong();
int armstrong()
{
	int n, p, q;
	cin>>n>>p>>q;
	int a=pow(n,p);
	if(a>=q)
	{
		return true;
	}
	else
	{
		return false;
	}
}
int main()
{
	if(armstrong()==1)
	{
		cout<<"Doctor, you can proceed with your experiment."<<"\n";
	}
	else
	{
		cout<<"Sorry Doctor! You need more bacteria.";
	}
}
