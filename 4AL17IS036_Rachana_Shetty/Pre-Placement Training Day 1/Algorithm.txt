ALGORITHM TO COUNT SISTINCT ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY:

Step 1: Input the number of elements to be entered in an array.
Step 2: Input the array elements using for loop.
Step 3: Traverse the array from the beginning using 2 for loops.
Step 4: Using if condition, check whether the array elements pointed by 2 indexes are same.
Step 5: If they are same, then break the loop.
Step 6: Else increment the count value and print it.
Step 7: Continue the iteration until the condition is satisfied.
