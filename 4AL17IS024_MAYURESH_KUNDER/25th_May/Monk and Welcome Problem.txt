Question:
Having a good previous year, Monk is back to teach algorithms and data structures. This year he welcomes the learners with a problem which he calls "Welcome Problem". The problem gives you two arrays A and B (each array of size N) and asks to print new array C such that:
 ; 
Now, Monk will proceed further when you solve this one. So, go on and solve it :)

Program:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int A[100000],B[00000],C[100000],N,i;
    scanf("%d",&N);
    for(i=1;i<=N;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&A[i]);
        C[i] = A[i];
    }
    for(i=1;i<=N;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&B[i]);
        C[i] += B[i];
        printf("%d ",C[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
