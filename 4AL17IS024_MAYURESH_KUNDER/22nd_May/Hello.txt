Question:
Kirti is new to programming and she doesn't know how to code. Can you write a code, which would print "Hello Kirti" on the screen.


Program:

import java.util.*;


class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {

            System.out.println("Hello Kirti");

    }
}
