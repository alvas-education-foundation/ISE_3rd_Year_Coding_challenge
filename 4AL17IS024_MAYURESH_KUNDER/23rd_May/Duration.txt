class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {

            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

            int works = sc.nextInt();

            for(int i =0;i<works;i++)
            {
                int sh = sc.nextInt();
                int sm = sc.nextInt();
                int eh = sc.nextInt();
                int em = sc.nextInt();

                if(sh<=12 && eh<=12)
                {
                    int hours = (eh-sh)-1;
                    sm = 60 - sm;
                    int mins = sm+em;
                    if(mins>60)
                    {
                        mins -= 60;
                    }
                    System.out.println(hours+" "+mins);
                }
                else
                {
                     int hours = eh-sh;
                    sm = 60 - sm;
                    int mins = sm+em;
                    if(mins>60)
                    {
                        mins -= 60;
                    }
                    System.out.println(hours+" "+mins);
                }
