Question:
On a distant planet far away from Earth lives a boy named Aman.He loves to run everyday.But his running distance is directly affected by how much horlicks his mother mixed in his milk today.If his mother has mixed x grams of horlicks,then Aman will be capable of running 100*x meters at most on that day.

Aman's instructor, Mr.Sharma ,is a very strict yet very caring.Everyday he asks Aman to run around a circle of radius r once.If Aman is able to complete the circle,he would get a toffee.

Note:Take value of pie=22/7.

Program:

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        

       // BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int tofee = 0;
        long d = s.nextLong();
        for(int i=0;i<d;i++)
        {
            long r = s.nextLong();
            long x = s.nextLong();
            long circumference = 44*r;
            long meter = x*700;
            if(meter>circumference)
            {
                tofee++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(tofee);

    }
}
