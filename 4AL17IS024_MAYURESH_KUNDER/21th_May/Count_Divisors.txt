Question:
You have been given 3 integers - l, r and k. Find how many numbers between l and r (both inclusive) are divisible by k. You do not need to print these numbers, you just have to find their count.


Program:
import java.util.*;

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
       Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
       int l = s.nextInt();
       int r = s.nextInt();
       int k = s.nextInt();
       int c = 0;

       for(int i=l;i<=r;i++)
       {
           if(i%k==0)
           {
               c++;
           }
       }

       System.out.println(c);
    }
}
