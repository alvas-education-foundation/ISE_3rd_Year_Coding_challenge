Program:

import java.util.*;
class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        
        int z=0,o=0,z1;
        Scanner r = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = r.next();
        int len = s.length();
        if(len<=20)
        {
            for(int i=0;i<len;i++)
            {
                if(s.charAt(i)=='z')
                {
                    z++;
                }
                else
                {
                    o++;
                }
            }
            z1=z*2;
            if(o==z1)
            System.out.println("Yes");
            else
            System.out.println("No");
        }

    }
