Microwave oven
A microwave oven manufacturer recommends to increase the heating time by 50% when two items are heated and to double the heating time when three items are heated. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Now, write a program to find out the recommended heating time.
INPUT FORMAT:

The first input is an integer which denotes the number of items

The second input is a floating point number which denotes the single item heating time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the recommended heating time in floating point with 2 decimal places.

If the number of items is more than three, print "Number of items is more".

Refer the sample output for formatting.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2

5.0

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7.50

PROGRAM:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  //Type your code here.
  int a;
  float b,c,d,f;
  std::cin>>a>>b;
  c=a*b;
  d=(b*50)/100;
  if(a<=2)
    std::cout<<c-d;
  else if(a==3)
    std::cout<<2*b;
  else
    std::cout<<"Number of items is more";
}
