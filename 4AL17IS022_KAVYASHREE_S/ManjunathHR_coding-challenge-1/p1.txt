1.Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.
Test case:
Number 1 – 20
Number 2 – 20.38
Sum = 40.38
There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.

program:

#include <iostream>

#include<cmath>


using namespace std;

int main()

{
	
	int x;
	
	float y;
	
	cout<<"Enter 2 numbers: ";
	
	cin>>x>>y;

	if(isnan(x) || isnan(y))

	{

		cout<<"Error";

	}

	else

		cout<<"Sum= "<<(float)x+y;

	return 0;

}
