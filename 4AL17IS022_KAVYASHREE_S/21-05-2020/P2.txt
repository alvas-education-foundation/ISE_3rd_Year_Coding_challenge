She joins all the small pieces of the chalk and makes another chalk of the same size and uses it. If she uses one chalk each day, in how many days will she use the given n number of chalks?
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consist of 1 integer which corresponds to the number of chalks given. Output corresponds to the number of days in which the given number of chalks will be used.
