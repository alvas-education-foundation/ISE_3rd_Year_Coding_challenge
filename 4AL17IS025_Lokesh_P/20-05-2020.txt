4.Sum of squares
That was awesome!

Write a program to print the sum of squares of the elements of an array of size N. N can be any integer between 1 and 100. 

Instructions:

We have defined an integer variable N for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for variable N.
We have defined an integer array .
We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
You have to write the logic to add the squares of array elements.
Print the sum.
Sample Input
N = 5
Array = 4 7 2 8 5

Sample Output:
158
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void) {
    
	int N, i;
	scanf("%d", &N);
 
	int numArray[N]; // Define an array of four integers
    
	// Get inputs for the array elements
	for (i=0;i<N; i++) {
    	scanf("%d", &numArray[i]);
	}
	
	int sum = 0;
	// Write here the logic to add these integers:
    for (i=0;i<N; i++) {
		sum=sum+(numArray[i]*numArray[i]);
	}
    
    
   
	printf("%d\n",sum);  // Print the sum
    
	return 0;
}
5.Range of Integers
Write a program to list all the integers between two integers L and R (including L and R). L and R can be any integer between 1 and 100. 

Instructions:

We have defined the integer variables L and R for you.
We have provided the code to get inputs for the variables.
Print all the integers between L and R (including L and R) with space between them
Sample Input:
L = 5, R = 10

Sample Output:
5 6 7 8 9 10
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    // Define the two integer variables
    int L,R;
    int i;

    // Get L and R from the user
    scanf("%d", &L);
    scanf("%d", &R);

    // Write here the logic to print all integers between L and R
    for(i=L;i<=R;i++)
        printf("%d ", i);

    printf("\n");


    return 0;
}
6.Add two arrays
Write a program to add the corresponding elements of two arrays, each of size N and print the sums. N can be any integer between 1 and 100. 

Instructions:

We have defined an integer variable N for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for variable N.
We have defined integer arrays ,  and .
We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
You have to write the logic to add the array elements.
Store the sum values in respective elements of variable 
Print all the elements of  with space between them
Sample Input:
N = 3
 = 3 9 8
 = 8 12 74

Sample Output:
11 21 82
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int N, i;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    // Declare the two arrays
    int numArrayA[N], numArrayB[N], sumArray[N];

    for(i=0;i<N;i++) sumArray[i]=0;

    // Get the numArray1
    for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &numArrayA[i]);
    }

    // Get the numArray2
    for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &numArrayB[i]);
    }

    // Write your logic here:
    for(i=0;i<N;i++)
        sumArray[i] = numArrayA[i] + numArrayB[i];


    // Print the sumArray
    for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
        printf("%d ", sumArray[i]);
    }
    // Print a newline at the end 
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
