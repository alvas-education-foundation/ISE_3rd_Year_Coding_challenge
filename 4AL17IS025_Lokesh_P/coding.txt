1.Maths and logic are the necessary parts of programming that can be learned through practice. Here is a simple mathematical problem of addition for you to solve.

Write a program to print the sum of two integers.

Instructions:

We have defined two integer variables  and  for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for the two variables.
You have to write the logic to add the two variables.
Print the sum.
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(){
	
	int num1, num2;   // Define two integer variables
    
	
	scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);  // Get input for the two variables
    
	int sum = 0;
	// Write the logic to add these numbers here:
    sum=num1+num2;
	
	printf("%d\n", sum);   // Print the sum
	return 0;
}
2.Well, that was easy. Isn’t it? Now we’ll go one step further and do the sum of elements of an array.

Write a program to print the sum of all the elements of an array of size 4.

Instructions:

We have defined an integer array  for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
You have to write the logic to add the elements.
Print the sum.
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void) {
	
	int numArray[4];   // Define an array of four integers
        int i;
	// Get inputs for the array elements
	for (i=0; i<4; i++) 
	{
    	scanf("%d", &numArray[i]);
	}
    
	int sum = 0;
	for(i=0;i<4;i++)
	{
	    sum=sum+numArray[i];
	}
	printf("%d\n",sum);   // Print the sum
    
	return 0;
}
3.Write a program to print the sum of all the elements of an array of size N where N can be any integer between 1 and 100. 

Instructions:

We have defined an integer variable N for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for variable N.
We have defined an integer array .
We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
You have to write the logic to add the array elements.
Print the sum.
Sample Input:
N = 3
Array = 6 3 8

Sample Output:
17
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void) {
    
	int N, i;
	scanf("%d", &N);
 
	int numArray[N]; // Define an array of four integers
    
	// Get inputs for the array elements
	for (i=0;i<N; i++) {
    	scanf("%d", &numArray[i]);
	}
	
	int sum = 0;
	// Write here the logic to add these integers:
    for (i=0;i<N; i++)
	 {
		 sum=sum+numArray[i];
	 }
    
    
   
	printf("%d\n",sum);  // Print the sum
    
	return 0;
}
