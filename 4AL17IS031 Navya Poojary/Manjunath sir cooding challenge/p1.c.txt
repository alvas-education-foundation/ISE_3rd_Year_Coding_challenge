/*1. Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.
Test case:
Number 1 – 20
Number 2 – 20.38
Sum = 40.38
There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.
