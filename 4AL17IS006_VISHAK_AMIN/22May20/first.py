# Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, 

# Input Format

# Four integers  and  each on four separate lines, respectively.

# Constraints

# Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.
